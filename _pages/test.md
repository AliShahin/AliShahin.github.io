Large Language Models (LLMs) can memorize and leak sensitive training data, posing serious
privacy risks. To assess such memorization and information leakage, we introduced CAMIA
(Context-Aware Membership Inference Attack), the first method tailored to the generative nature
of LLMs, which nearly doubles detection accuracy compared to prior approaches and reveals
where memorization truly occurs.
