This is Ali Shahin Shmasabadi's home on the web! 
I am currently a third-year PhD student of Centre for Intelligent Sensing (CIS) in the school of Electronic Enginnering and Computer Science (EECS) at Queen Mary University of London. Meanwhile, I am a visiting student of Imperial College London and a Enrichment student at Alan Turing Institue. I love to explore the intersection of Machine Learning, Privacy and Image Processing.
