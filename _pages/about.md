This is Dr Ali Shahin Shmasabadi! 
I am a Research Associate at the [Artificial intelligence (Safe and ethical)](https://www.turing.ac.uk/research/research-programmes/artificial-intelligence-ai/safe-and-ethical) under supervision of [Adrian Weller](http://mlg.eng.cam.ac.uk/adrian/) at [The Alan Turing Institute](https://www.turing.ac.uk). Meanwhile, I am a visitor at [CleverHans Lab](https://cleverhans-lab.github.io) where I was a Postdoctoral Fellow under the supervision of [Nicolas Papernot](https://www.papernot.fr) at [Vector Institute](https://vectorinstitute.ai) before joining the Turing.
I have received a PhD in Computer Science from the Queen Mary University of London. During my PhD, I did internships at Inria (with [Aurélien Bellet](http://researchers.lille.inria.fr/abellet/) and [Emmanuel Vincent](https://members.loria.fr/EVincent/) on the intersection of differential privacy and audio) and The Alan Turing Institue (with [Adria Gascon](https://www.lsi.upc.edu/~agascon/) and [Matt Kusner](https://mkusner.github.io) on the intersection of multi-party computation and machine learning). I was also a PhD visitor at Imperial College London working with [Hamed Haddadi](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/h.haddadi).

## Research 
I love to explore the intersection of Machine Learning, Privacy, Fairness and Image/Audio Processing!<br />
My research interests and recent works include:
- Designing machine learning models tailored to privacy enhancement technologies (see [QUOTIENT](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1907.03372) and [PrivEdge](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.05574))
- Differential privacy for images/audios and graphs (see [DPspeech](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2202.11823.pdf), [GAP](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2203.00949.pdf))
- Privacy attacks (see [trap weights](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.02918.pdf))
- Designing adversarial examples by considering image/audio semantics (see [ColorFool](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_CVPR_2020/papers/Shamsabadi_ColorFool_Semantic_Adversarial_Colorization_CVPR_2020_paper.pdf), [Mystique](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2202.02751.pdf), [EdgeFool](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1910.12227.pdf), [FilterFool](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.06069.pdf) and [FoolHD](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.08483.pdf))
- Data privacy and edge computing (see [DarkneTZ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.05703) and [Private-Feature Extraction](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1802.03151.pdf))
