This is Dr Ali Shahin Shamsabadi (ashahinshamsabadi@brave.com)! I am a Privacy Researcher at [Brave Software](https://brave.com). Before joining Brave Software, I was a Research Associate at [The Alan Turing Institute](https://www.turing.ac.uk) under the supervision of [Adrian Weller](http://mlg.eng.cam.ac.uk/adrian/), and a Postdoctoral Fellow at [Vector Institute](https://vectorinstitute.ai) under the supervision of [Nicolas Papernot](https://www.papernot.fr). During my PhD, I was very fortunate to work under [Aurélien Bellet](http://researchers.lille.inria.fr/abellet/), [Adria Gascon](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=M1FQ49sAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate), [Hamed Haddadi](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/h.haddadi), [Matt Kusner](https://mkusner.github.io) and [Emmanuel Vincent](https://members.loria.fr/EVincent/). 

Main blog posts I co-authored: [Verifiable differentially private ML](https://brave.com/confidential-dpproof/) and [Privacy risks in Federated Learning](https://www.cleverhans.io/2022/04/17/fl-privacy.html).

My research has been cited in the press including [Thurrott](https://www.thurrott.com/a-i/298422/brave-proposes-a-framework-to-ensure-machine-learning-models-are-trained-privately) and [TuringTop10](https://www.turing.ac.uk/sites/default/files/2023-06/pioneering_new_approaches_to_verifying_the_fairness_of_ai_models_0.pdf).


## Research 
My research interests lie in identifying and mitigating the potential risks stemming from the use of AI in high-stake decision systems to unleash the full potential of AI while safeguarding our fundamental values and keeping us safe and secure. In particular, I 
1. identify failure modes for AI systems by attacking them in terms of privacy ([Mnemonist](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=oVn5GLyONY), [Trap weights](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.02918.pdf)), fairness ([Fairwashing](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=3vmKQUctNy)) and security/safety ([ColorFool](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_CVPR_2020/papers/Shamsabadi_ColorFool_Semantic_Adversarial_Colorization_CVPR_2020_paper.pdf), [Mystique](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2202.02751.pdf), [EdgeFool](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1910.12227.pdf), [FilterFool](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.06069.pdf) and [FoolHD](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.08483.pdf));
2. mitigate these emerging risks by designing secure and trustworthy (privacy-preserving, robust, fair and explainable) AI to be deployed by institutions ([Losing Less](https://petsymposium.org/popets/2023/popets-2023-0083.pdf), [QUOTIENT](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1907.03372), [DPspeech](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2202.11823.pdf), [GAP](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2203.00949.pdf), [DarkneTZ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.05703) and [Private-Feature Extraction](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1802.03151.pdf) and [PrivEdge](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.05574)); 
3. build confidential and reliable auditing frameworks that can be used by the public to audit the trustworthiness of AI-driven services provided by institutions ([Confidential-DPproof](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=PQY2v6VtGe), [Confidential-PROFITT](https://openreview.net/forum?id=iIfDQVyuFD),  and [Zest](https://openreview.net/forum?id=OUz_9TiTv9j)). <br />

My research has been published at top-tier conferences including NeurIPS, ICLR, CVPR, CCS, USENIX Security and PETs.
