title: "EdgeFool: An Adversarial Image Enhancement Filter"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2019_10_15_EsgeFool
excerpt: 'Adversarial examples are intentionally perturbed images that mislead classifiers. These images can, however, be easily detected using denoising algorithms, when high-frequency spatial perturbations are used, or can be noticed by humans, when perturbations are large. In this paper, we propose EdgeFool, an adversarial image enhancement filter that learns structure-aware adversarial perturbations. EdgeFool generates adversarial images with perturbations that enhance image details via training a fully convolutional neural network end-to-end with a multi-task loss function. This loss function accounts for both image detail enhancement and class misleading objectives. We evaluate EdgeFool on three classifiers (ResNet-50, ResNet-18 and AlexNet) using two datasets (ImageNet and Private-Places365) and compare it with six adversarial methods (DeepFool, SparseFool, Carlini-Wagner, SemanticAdv, Non-targeted and Private Fast Gradient Sign Methods).'

Adversarial examples are intentionally perturbed images that mislead classifiers. These images can, however, be easily detected using denoising algorithms, when high-frequency spatial perturbations are used, or can be noticed by humans, when perturbations are large. In this paper, we propose EdgeFool, an adversarial image enhancement filter that learns structure-aware adversarial perturbations. EdgeFool generates adversarial images with perturbations that enhance image details via training a fully convolutional neural network end-to-end with a multi-task loss function. This loss function accounts for both image detail enhancement and class misleading objectives. We evaluate EdgeFool on three classifiers (ResNet-50, ResNet-18 and AlexNet) using two datasets (ImageNet and Private-Places365) and compare it with six adversarial methods (DeepFool, SparseFool, Carlini-Wagner, SemanticAdv, Non-targeted and Private Fast Gradient Sign Methods).
